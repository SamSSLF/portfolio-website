      Fable - A language-learning toy that supports the development of
      self-efficacy in children aged 3-7 years.
    </h1>
    <h3 class="mb-4">
      Fable is a digital-physical toy which aims to improve second language
      proficiency by leveraging self-efficacy theory (SET) as a mechanism that
      could help explain why some children thrive learning a second language
      whereas others struggle.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      The toy is underpinned by Bandura’s theory of self-efficacy, and current
      theories on intellectual development across the lifespan. An initial
      prototype was developed and tested with potential users and areas of
      improvement were noted for future iterations. As part of my Design
      Psychology module, an experimental design to test the toy’s claim that it
      can improve second language proficiency is outlined in a report that can
      be read here.

    <h1>Background and Context</h1>
    <p>
      The development of Fable stemmed from the observation that low proficiency
      in one’s heritage language prevents one from engaging meaningfully with
      your ethnic background, culture, and extended family who can only speak
      the heritage language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Language proficiency is closely correlated to an individual’s self-esteem
      and sense of identity, and bilingual children have also shown to have
      superior executive functioning skills compared to monolinguals and their
      brains are more resilient against age-related decline. Thus, second
      language proficiency can improve mental health of immigrant children and
      generally comes with many cognitive benefits that persist into adulthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the pre-operational stage of development, ages 3-7 years children
      begin to form complex sentences and maintain complex interactions - beyond
      the age of 7, children tend to focus more on reading and writing in
      schools. Our toy intends to target children at this key stage of their
      development.

    <h1>Insights from Psychology</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="font-bold">Self-Efficacy:</span> It's the belief in our
        ability to succeed in specific situations. It makes learners more
        persistent, especially in challenging tasks like language learning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="font-bold">Parental Value:</span> If parents don’t see the
        value in learning a new language, a child is less likely to put in the
        effort to learn it, regardless of their self-efficacy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="font-bold">Parental Input:</span> The quality and diversity
        of language that parents use with their children can impact the child’s
        language development. Activities like reading together can especially
        help in improving language skills in children.
