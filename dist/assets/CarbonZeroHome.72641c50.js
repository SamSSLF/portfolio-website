Mews are now located in the most desirable residential areas in London where they used to cater to the affluent residents of Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster. The modern mews has been renovated to suit contemporary needs; stables are usually converted into a garage or extra living space to accommodate a family. </p><p> I will be basing my housing case study on a real mews now for sale in Notting Hill for \xA32,000,000. Linden mews is a 2-bed, 2-bath home, located in a quiet gated street just off Notting Hill Square, W2. Based on the floorplan of this home, the mews was modelled in 3D so that the roof areas and internal areas could be accurately measured, and interventions clearly communicated. I do not have any knowledge of the house\u2019s current heating or water distribution systems, so I am imagining a complete renovation of the home to accommodate my proposal but rebuilt according to the existing floor plan of the house. The actual house shown above was also slightly altered to include a pitched roof without a room in the attic. </p><p> Before considering any investment in renewable sources of heat generation, it is imperative that the home retains heat well first. I propose to achieve this by insulating the loft above the ceiling and installing cavity insulation in the walls, and installing triple-glazed windows. </p><p> I then propose taking advantage of the mews\u2019 south-facing fa\xE7ade and installing photovoltaic panels on the roof, as well as a solar thermal water heating system. A thermal store system with closed triple coil loops would be used to heat the home. Two closed loops would utilise various renewable heat sources while the other closed loop would be connected to an electric boiler. An air-source heat pump would be installed at the front of the house to complement the solar thermal system. </p><h1>External and Internal Views after Intervention</h1></article><img src="'+s+'" alt="" class="col-span-full"><p class="mb-6 col-start-2 text-sm mt-3 tracking-wide font-semibold text-slate-500"> Facade after interventions have been installed. </p><img src="'+a+'" alt="" class="col-span-full"><p class="mb-6 col-start-2 text-sm mt-3 tracking-wide font-semibold text-slate-500"> Full section view of the home&#39;s facade.
